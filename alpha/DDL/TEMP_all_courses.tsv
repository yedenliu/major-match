Using ethnography as a methodological lens, we will develop in-depth analyses of research on global migration and immigration to the U.S, examining the influence of policy, public perception, and racism. We wlll explore the role of borders—physical, symbolic, or ideological—to understand how our conceptions of the border and our cultural and physical policing of these borders impact the everyday lives of immigrant families as well as the formation of self, identity, and community. Central to these narratives will be the forms of refusal and resistance that have historically shaped immigrants’ encounters with exclusion and marginalization. Students will also design inquiry-based research projects informed by our study of ethnography in education and that contributes to our understanding of the interplay between race, culture, ethnicity, and migration.
